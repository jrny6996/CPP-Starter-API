A ligthweight starter template for monolith C++ Webapps built with CrowC++
## Features

### Reactivity
CrowC++ is a backend webframework with relatively nice ways of setting up API routes. The inteded use case of this repo is for building full stack webapps with our reactivity managed through AJAX calls via HTMX.

### Styling
I setup the repo to use tailwind as I feel it balances customizability and developer velocity better than alternatives like Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks

## Usage

### Development



### Production
TBD, probably shipping build folder output is
